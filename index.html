                            <strong>Dear My Beautiful girl,</strong>
                            <p>
                                Where do I start with you miss Jordan Geer, I truly can't get enough of you... 
                                Baby the day I met you I was so nervous because you were so beautiful and I did not want to f*** it up,
                                but the good time we had at mini golf as I got my ass kicked was amazing! But all the dates have been amazing... The best part to me that day 
                                was getting to know you, as we were in some random parking lot, hearing you talk about yourself, your passions, why you are a nurse,
                                and your future goals I knew you were the one for me and I could not let you go! Honestly it was also inspiring and very surreal to
                                hear you tell me about yourself, that day I knew you were the one for me... Baby I love everything about you especially your personality 
                                as you have such a big heart and your so kind, sweet, caring person and I even love your weird/funny side because to me thats the best parts of you!
                                Jordan my favourite feature about you is your face as it's like the Mona Lisa is walking around today because it is so perfect, your big beautiful hazel eyes, your perfect nose,
                                your perfect lips and eyebrows, its like I could stare at you all day and I would not be able to stop because its just so PERFECT! Baby I also love your laugh as
                                it is so cute and your smile its so beautiful that one once said "Her smile, a pink sunsetâ€” perfect, pure, and softly set. In her glow, the world finds light, beauty at its finest sight".
                                Baby I have loved getting to know everything about you over the last month and a half and cannot wait to find out more about you from your family,
                                as I am really excited to meet all of them and know who raised the most beautiful girl in the world! Baby I hope I make your day special and I hope you are my girl
                                for the rest of my life because I truly can't get enough of you, baby you are the most beautiful girl in the world and I have told you so from Day 1 so
                                Happy Valentine's Day Baby!! 
                                <br>
